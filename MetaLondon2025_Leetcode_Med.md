#### Tips for Interview Preparation:
Top 5 Focus Areas:
Arrays & Hashing, Binary Search, Greedy Algorithms, Graphs, and Linked Lists are the most frequent in Meta’s interviews.

Practice frequently:
While there’s a large variety of problems, these topics are the most reliable in terms of interview prep.

Quality over Quantity: Rather than doing every question, ensure you can explain the core concepts, edge cases, and optimizations.

Good luck with your preparation!
